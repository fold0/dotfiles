Directory for scripts which should be conditionally installed in PATH.

For each script with a companion *.cond script:
  * we run *.cond script to test whether script should be installed
  * on check success: symlink script into ~/.local/bin/
  * on check failure: remove the symlink from ~/.local/bin/ if points to bin-cond
