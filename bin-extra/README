Directory for scripts which should be conditionally installed in PATH.

For each script with a companion *.check script:
  * we run *.check script to test whether script should be installed
  * on check success: symlink script into ~/.local/bin
  * on check failure: remove the symlink from ~/.local/bin if points to bin-extra
